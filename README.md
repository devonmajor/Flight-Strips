# To-Do List Application

A simple and modern To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as manage subtasks. Tasks are color-coded based on their due dates, and the application supports drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks with details like project, client, required work, and due date.
- **Edit Tasks**: Edit existing tasks to update their details.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Subtasks**: Add and manage subtasks for each task.
- **Color-Coded Tasks**: Tasks are color-coded based on how close their due date is.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Reorder tasks using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- (Optional) Node.js and `http-server` if you want to run a local development server.
